# Ei-Study Coding Exercise
This repository contains the solutions to two key coding exercises completed as part of the Ei Study program.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Design Patterns Implementation

- Comprehensive Java implementations encompassing Behavioral, Creational, and Structural design patterns.
- Includes practical examples such as Command, Strategy, Builder, Decorator, Facade, and Prototype patterns.
- Focuses on writing clean, maintainable code applying SOLID principles.

### Exercise 2: Satellite Command System

- A simulation of satellite controls implemented as a console application in Java.
- Demonstrates the use of the Command design pattern for modular and scalable command execution.
- Features satellite orientation control, solar panel management, and data collection with robust error handling and logging.

## Technologies Used

- Java SE 8 or higher
- Core Java libraries (Collections, I/O, Date-Time API)
- Console-based user interaction
