# Ei-Study Coding Exercise
This repository contains the solutions to two key coding exercises completed as part of the Ei Study program.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Design Patterns Implementation

- This exercise covers the implementation of key software design patterns such as Command, Strategy, Builder, Decorator, Facade, and Prototype.
- Each pattern is implemented in Java with unique, practical, and easy-to-understand examples.
- Focus on clean code, SOLID principles, and real-world applicability.

### Exercise 2: Satellite Command System

- A Java console application simulating satellite operations.
- Implements the Command design pattern for modular command execution.
- Supports controlling satellite orientation, solar panel state, and data collection.
- Includes user interaction, exception handling, and logging for robustness.

## Technologies Used

- Java SE (version 8 or above)
- Standard Java libraries for collection handling, I/O, and date-time processing
- Console-based user interfaces for simplicity and focus on core logic

## Project Structure

- `exercise1-design-patterns/` - Source code demonstrating design patterns.
- `exercise2-satellite-command-system/` - Source code for the satellite control application.

## How to Run

1. Import the repository in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
2. Navigate to the respective exercise folder.
3. Compile and run the main class for the desired exercise.
4. Follow the console instructions to interact with the programs.

## Key Features

- Well-structured object-oriented code adhering to best practices.
- Use of classical and advanced design patterns to solve practical problems.
- Robust input validation and error handling.
- Modular and maintainable code, suitable for production-quality standards.
